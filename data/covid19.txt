Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[10] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic.[11][12] The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019.[13] Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from Milan and Turin, Italy on 18 December 2019.[14] As of 25 June 2020, more than 9.39 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 481,000 deaths. More than 4.71 million people have recovered.[9]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.[15][6][7][16] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[17] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.[18][19][20] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.[6][21]

The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking.[7][22][24] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.[7] However, research as of June 2020 has shown that speech-generated droplets may remain airborne for tens of minutes.[25] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[7][22] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.[7][22] The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.[26] Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.[27][28]
